/*This query links together the Employee, Orders, and Customer tables to provide a detailed look at the performance of each employee in terms of sales. 
It's designed to measure not only how much revenue each employee is generating but also how many unique customers they're serving 
and the average value of the orders they handle. The aim is to pinpoint which employees are excelling not just in sales 
but in attracting a diverse clientele, indicating their effectiveness in both service and salesmanship. 
The results are organized by the total revenue generated in descending order, ensuring the top performers stand out immediately. 
This setup guarantees that the information fits neatly on a single screen, making it easy to digest at a glance.
